### Explore US Bikeshare Data

#### Description
This project is about exploring US bikeshare data of three cities namely Chicago, New York and Washington. You can see basic stats like which is the most common start staion, end station and combination of both. Plots are generated using ggplot2 to better understand the usage pattern.

#### Libraries Used
Following are the libraries that go behind the working of this project:
* [**dplyr**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8): dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.
* [**ggplot2**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.3.0): ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.
* [**lubridate**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lubridate/versions/1.7.8): Lubridate is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times.

#### Files used
Following are the three files used for this project:
* Chicago bikeshare data
* New York bikeshare data
* Washington bikeshare data

The data is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

#### Credits
This project is created as part of Udacity's Nanodegree program.
Apart from the Udacity program content, I took help some tutorials on youtube and read r documentation about date manipulation and finding some basic stats using dplyr and lubridate:
* [Hands-on dplyr tutorial for faster data manipulation in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWjqLW-u3hc&t=97s) by Data School
* [lubridate](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lubridate) by RDocumentation
